# Multipaste

Multipaste is a Figma plugin that allows for copy and pasting elements to many frames at once. No more pasting frame-by-frame! Use this plugin to boost your workflow.

## Shortcut
A simpler way to use plugins is by creating shortcuts. To create a shortcut, click on Figma at your system's navbar, then 'Services', 'Services Preferences', 'App shortcuts' and add a new shortcut for Figma. If you wish to use Multipaste with a shortcut, here is my suggested path:

 - For copying
	 >Menu title: Plugins->Multipaste->Copy (⌃⌘C)
	 
 - For pasting
	 >Menu title: Plugins->Multipaste->Copy (⌃⌘V)

If you wish, you can also create a shortcut for clearing plugin cache by following the same procedure. Just switch the command and choose a shortcut
